1.	Config Server - Centralized configuration management.
2.	Eureka Server - Service discovery.
3.	API Gateway - Routing and load balancing.
4.	User Profile Service - Manages user profiles.
5.	Auth Service - Handles authentication and JWT token management.
6.	Treatment Service - Tracks and manages treatment details.
7.	Bookmark Service - Allows bookmarking of treatments.
8.	Kafka - Event streaming between services.
9.	MySQL - Relational database management.
